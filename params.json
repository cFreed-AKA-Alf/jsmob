{"name":"Jsmob","tagline":"A JS add-on to instantly make an existing site become responsive","body":"![Screenshot: jsmob presentation](https://github.com/cFreed-AKA-Alf/jsmob/blob/master/jsmob.full.jpg)\r\n\r\n#### What is it?\r\nThe **jsmob** project is an attempt to have a **simpe and easy to use** javascript module which can be added to any existing site to instantly make it become responsive with a minimum effort.  \r\nThere is no attempt (at least for now) to minimize the loading time (like selecting between different versions of images or different dedicated CSS files depending on the device window size, and so on).\r\n\r\nIn contrast, \"simple and easy to use\" means that for jsmob to work on a site you must only:\r\n- hook the `jsmob.js` file\r\n- add a few number of class names to define the desired behaviour\r\n- and sometimes adapt the columns HTML structure, and therefore turn some `#ident` CSS specifications into `.ident`.\r\n\r\n#### What does it look like?\r\nYou may [examine a test case in operation](http://eminet.fr/jsmob): either observe it in different window sizes on a desktop, or using a mobile device.  \r\nYou will notice that it allows to have different breakpoints for different parts of the page, and it adapts instantly when switching between portrait and landscape.\r\n\r\nWhen a page part passes its defined breakpoint, depending on its own settings:\r\n- adjacent columns become stacked (in a different order than in full layout, if so defined)\r\n- a hover-sensitive menu becomes touch-sensitive (and is replaced by a \"commander\" button, if marked as main menu)\r\n- elements marked as optional disappear from the page\r\n- and some other little touchy behaviours\r\n\r\n#### How to use it on your own test case?\r\nLook at the readme.md file in the [**jsmob** project repository](https://github.com/cFreed-AKA-Alf/jsmob) for detailed information.\r\n\r\n#### Your help is needed!\r\nThis project may become a useful tool **only if you**, guys, try it in a number of various contexts, upon a number of different old existing sites, and give me feedback on how it [un?]successfully works.\r\nThanks in advance for your comments.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
